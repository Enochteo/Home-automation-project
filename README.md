# Home Automation Dashboard
A web-based dashboard designed to monitor and control smart home devices in real time. This project integrates IoT hardware with a clean user interface to provide centralized control, live sensor data, and automation features for smart environments.

## Description
The Home Automation Dashboard connects with microcontrollers (like ESP32) to control and monitor devices such as lights, fans, temperature sensors, and more. The system collects data from IoT devices, displays it in an intuitive dashboard, and allows users to trigger actions manually or automatically based on rules.

## Features
Real-time device status updates and control

Live sensor data (temperature, humidity, etc.)

Responsive web interface for desktop and mobile

Automation logic (e.g., turn on fan when temp > 30°C)

Secure user authentication (optional)

Modular and extensible device support

## Tech Stack
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (optional React upgrade)

Backend: Flask (Python)

Microcontroller: ESP32 or Arduino with WiFi support

Database: SQLite or Firebase (for cloud sync)

Other: MQTT or HTTP for device communication, Chart.js for data visualization
